### The Game

Chalaam's Endless Forest Run
In the heart of a whispering, enchanted forest, little Chalaamâ€”a bright-eyed orphan with a tattered cloak and a fearless grinâ€”dashes through towering trees and glowing mushrooms. Vines sway, fireflies dance, and mysterious creatures peek from behind mossy trunks as he runs forward through the endless scroller. Every leap over a root or swing from a branch carries him closer to uncovering the forestâ€™s secretsâ€¦ and maybe, just maybe, a place where he truly belongs. ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
